\section{Environment and demo}

It's advised to setup anaconda with a virtual environment for running all the jupyter notebooks and the streamlit app code smoothly. We did set up a conda environment with this command `conda create -n dic587semproj python=3.11` and used explicitly this environment for any development purposes. The installed packages in this environment is inside the `requirements.txt` file which has been attached to our code inside /src folder for better smooth environment set up. To run the final demo code, you need to go to `src/phase3` directory in terminal, activate the environment and run `streamlit run app.py`. It would automatically direct to your locally hosted app window in a browser. Toggle with different parameters and hit "Predict" and it instantly gives you a prediction based on the inputs.
